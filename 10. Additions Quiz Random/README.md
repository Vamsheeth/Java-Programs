Create a JSF page that generates addition questions randomly.

The output should have the following appearance:

22 + 73 = [95] Correct

29 + 86 = [115] Correct

34 + 42 = [77] Incorrect

//10 such questions

[Submit] [Generate New Questions]

 

Here the numbers 22 and 73 are randomly generated, and placed on outputLabels. The result is typed in by the user in an inputText field. The response “Correct” or “Incorrect” is generated by the computer, and depends on the input submitted by the user. The response may be placed on an outputLabel.

Place two command buttons with text Submit and [Generate New Questions] as indicated.

When the Submit button is clicked, the response is the number of correct answers.

When the Generate New Questions button is clicked, the result is a new set of 10 questions.
